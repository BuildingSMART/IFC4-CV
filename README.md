IFC4 Coordination View
======================

The goal of this project is to specify the subset of the [new IFC4 release] (http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/ifc-releases/ifc4-release/ifc4-release-summary) that supports  coordination activities, also known as Coordination View. The work will be based on the [IFC2x3 CV] (http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/certification/ifc-certification-2.0/ifc2x3-cv-v2.0-certification/ifc2x3-cv-v2.0-certification-summary) that is currently used by buildingSMART for software certification. Two correlated partial views will be developed:
* Design handover view 
* Reference view
